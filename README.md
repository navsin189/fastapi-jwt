## Auth Meachnisim using FastAPI and JWT

> Python 3.10.12

### Scripts
- data_generator.py
  - Used Faker library to generate random users.
  - Not using it anymore due to JWT authentication.
- main_without_jwt.py
  - This script is an initial implementation of backend with any authentication.
  - Due to JWT, It is not needed any more.

### Templates and Static
- Initally I thought to make it full stack but this project is just for testing.
